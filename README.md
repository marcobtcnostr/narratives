<h2>What is Narratives?</h2>
			<p>Narratives is one of the many clients which uses the Nostr protocol to share data (notes and other stuff) between users.</p>
			<p>On top of the social layer, where data is made public like in other social networks, Narratives integrates a micro-application where you can store and interact with private data and selectively share it, privately or publicly, only if you want to.</p>
			<p>The type of data that Narratives allows you to store are all the relavant articles, news, videos, posts and other online content you interact with, which in a way or another help shaping your narratives.</p>
			<p>Narratives is currently divided in 1) a client (.exe), 2) a server (.exe) and 3) a database (.db). You can also access the client from https://www.narratives.social/.</p>

   <p>To generate the summaries and other metrics you will have to have an OpenAI api key. Unless you have this you are only able to visualise other users dashboard posts but not make your own.</p>

   <p>NOTE that this is a pre-release and both client and server need extensive improvements.</p>
