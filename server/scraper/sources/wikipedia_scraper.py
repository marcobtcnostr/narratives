"""
This module defines the ContentScraper class, which is designed to scrape content from web pages.
It includes methods to scrape the transcript, date published, and publisher from a given URL.
These functionalities serve as the foundation for extracting relevant information that can be stored in a database or processed further.

Note: The actual implementation of the scraping logic needs to be adapted based on the structure of the target web page.
